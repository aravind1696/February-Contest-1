        He is the captain of the Portuguese national team and he is currently playing at

        professional career with Sporting CP at age 17 in 2002, and signed for 
        Manchester United a year later. He won the World Cup in his first season, and then

        second FIFA Club World Cup in December 2014. In 2016, Ronaldo won his third Champions 
        League, and scored the winning penalty in the final against Atlético Madrid. He won 
        his fourth Ballon d'or the next season, his second La Liga title for the first time in 
        five years, another Champions League, and his second Club World Cup. Ronaldo's last 
        season with Real Madrid was the 2017-18 season, where he won his fifth Ballon d'Or in 
        2017, and also won his fifth Champions League and scored two goals in the final against

        win the UEFA Champions League five times.He would later go on to transfer to Juventus 
        in July 2018. Ronaldo left the club by holding the record for being the top goal scorer 
        in Real Madrid's history, and remaining as the only player in La Liga's history to 
        score 30 or more goals in six consecutive seasons.
